-- Question
-- Write an SQL query to report the IDs of all the employees with missing information. The information of an employee is missing if:
-- The employee's name is missing, or
-- The employee's salary is missing.
-- Return the result table ordered by employee_id in ascending order.


-- Input: 
-- Employees table:

-- +-------------+----------+
-- | 2           | Crew     |
-- | 4           | Haven    |

-- | 4           | 63539  |
-- +-------------+--------+
-- Output: 
-- +-------------+
-- | employee_id |

-- Employees 1, 2, 4, and 5 are working at this company.
-- The name of employee 1 is missing.
-- The salary of employee 2 is missing.


-- APPROACH
-- 1. full outer join of salaries and Employees
-- 2. where name is null or where employee_id is null

-- SOLUTION 1
SELECT T.employee_id
FROM  
  (SELECT * FROM Employees LEFT JOIN Salaries USING(employee_id)
   UNION 
   SELECT * FROM Employees RIGHT JOIN Salaries USING(employee_id))
AS T
WHERE T.salary IS NULL OR T.name IS NULL
ORDER BY employee_id;
