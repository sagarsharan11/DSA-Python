# Input: nums = [4,5,2,1], queries = [3,10,21]
# Output: [2,3,4]
# Explanation: We answer the queries as follows:
# - The subsequence [2,1] has a sum less than or equal to 3. It can be proven that 2 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[0] = 2.
# - The subsequence [4,5,1] has a sum less than or equal to 10. It can be proven that 3 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[1] = 3.
# - The subsequence [4,5,2,1] has a sum less than or equal to 21. It can be proven that 4 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[2] = 4.

# Input: nums = [2,3,4,5], queries = [1]
# Output: [0]
# Explanation: The empty subsequence is the only subsequence that has a sum less than or equal to 1, so answer[0] = 0.
